        where open spaces are 0 and closed spaces are 1
        and a coordinate system where [0][0] is the top-
        left corner, and x increases to the right while
        y increases going down (this is an arbitrary
        convention choice -- there are many other options
        that are just as good)
    
    _parity: bool
        Keep track of active player initiative (which
        player has control to move) where 0 indicates that
        player one has initiative and 1 indicates player two
    
    _player_locations: list(tuple)
        Keep track of the current location of each player
        on the board where position is encoded by the
        board indices of their last move, e.g., [(0, 0), (1, 0)]
        means player one is at (0, 0) and player two is at (1, 0)

## Something's wrong with the get_legal_moves function
- The logic is not right. The active player can move to any open cell diagonal from the current position given no blocker on the way. What I implented was the player can only move to the diagonal one step away.
